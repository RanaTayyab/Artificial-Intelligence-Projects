# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects

Developed the whole game "The Chess" in JAVA and made the
opponent player intelligent with MiniMax & Alpha-Beta Pruning
Approach and writing the Evaluation Function for better game playing.

Hand written digits taken from MNIST dataset of digit recognition was
given and with this training data, compared the performance of simple
threshold perceptron, trained using learning rule, a sigmoid unit using
gradient descent learning and a sigmoid unit trained using Genetic
Algorithm.
